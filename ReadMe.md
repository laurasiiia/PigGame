This was the third project i made from the Javascript course, made last week.

You roll the dice how many times you want, and the values of the result are being added to your current points. You can hold your points, then, they are added to you score. If your score hits 100, you win!

But, if you roll a 1, your current points go straight to zero, nothing is added to your score, and its the other players turn.

Just like the first project, the HTML and CSS were not coded by me, as they were provided by the teacher. But i had a blast coding the Javascript part and can't wait to code another game like this again!
